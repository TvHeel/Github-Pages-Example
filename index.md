## Thomas van Heel - Cyber Security

Welkom bij mijn e-portfolio! Dit e-portfolio is opgesteld ter verantwoording van de cyber security minor. Hierin wil ik jullie graag meenemen in mijn minor periode. Dit portfolio zal alles te maken hebben met cyber security, in het specifiek mijn gekozen richting: Red Teaming. Red Teaming heb ik gekozen, omdat hier mijn hart en intresses het meeste liggen. Alle aspecten van security spreken me aan, maar de aanvallende kant is de kant waar ik me graag in verder wil ontwikkelen. [Project(en)](https://tvheel.github.io/project), leermomenten, informatie etc. wordt allemaal beschreven.

Technical Red teaming skills are related to (IT) security technical skills, such as (but not limited to): hacking techniques (scripting, enumeration, privesc, pivoting, covert channels, exploitation, cracking, ...), physical security (locks, physical access tokens), offensive hardware (rubber ducky, dropbox, etc.), different target platforms (IoT, OT, mobile, ..) and environments (Windows, Linux, Android, ...).

### Onderbouwing (Technical skills)
I have done a lot of work on expanding my red teaming technical skills. I have learned a lot of hacking techniques from [Hack the Box](/results/htb) where I also learned how to target different platforms(Windows, Linux, OpenBSD), physical security aspects and offensive hardwared from using: P4wnp1, wifi pineapple, rubber ducky, packet squirrel and dropbox which I described in [P4wnP1](/results/p4wnp1) and [Tooling](/results/tooling). I also did IoT security testing described in [R&D Project](project).

Procedural red teaming skills are related to working in a structured way and reporting activity and results.
Working in a structured way: using proven (real world) methods/phases to perform pentests and red teaming operations, planning activities by considering efficiency combined with risk of damage and exposure. Working with written consent, ethically,  and in close cooperation with white team to prevent accidents.
Reporting activity and results:  written report to client/blue team/development (accompanied with a presentation), registering performed red teaming activity (was it a red teamer or a malicious actor?), documenting security tests (secure code review report, what is and isn't tested). Written responsible disclosure and PoCs. Knowledge sharing with peers in the field (informal, online, conferences).

### Learning outcome 3: Research and development skills

### Onderbouwing (Technical R&D project skills)
I think my Technical R&D project skills is at beginning, at this moment I have not yet described enough of our work that it's enough to confirm this learning outcome.
I will expand this in the comming weeks.
